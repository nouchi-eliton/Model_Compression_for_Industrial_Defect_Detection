# Model Compression for Industrial Defect Detection
In industrial quality control, defect detection is a crucial process that aims to identify defective products before they leave the production line. Deep learning models are a good option to this task; However, very deep architectures require powerful hardware for deployment and can introduce bottlenecks in the production line due to high inference latency. For these reasons, this project explores the application of model compression techniques to visual defect detection models, aiming to reduce models storage size and inference latency.

## Compression techniques
**Knowledge distillation** consists of training a large, complex neural network (the teacher) to guide the training of a smaller model (the student). This technique enables the use of a faster and more compact models with minimal loss in accuracy.

**Network quantization**
